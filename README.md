# Backend meets Frontend: Testing with Docker and jUnit5
Docker is also a wonderful tool for test environments. But that is not always trivial. The open source project TestContainers starts right here and helps Java developers combine Docker with jUnit. "Backend meets Frontend" takes a look at the tool and its possibilities.


## How to start
To play with this you only have to start the main - method from the class  ```org.rapidpm.vaadin.helloworld.server.Main``` and 
go with your browser to the address: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Ok, you got your first Vaadin "Hello World".
